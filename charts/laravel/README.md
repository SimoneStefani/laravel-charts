Laravel Helm Chart
==================

Containerize & Orchestrate your Laravel application with this simple Helm chart.

## ü§ù Supporting

Renoki Co. on GitHub aims on bringing a lot of open source projects and helpful projects to the world. Developing and maintaining projects everyday is a harsh work and tho, we love it.

If you are using your application in your day-to-day job, on presentation demos, hobby projects or even school projects, spread some kind words about our work or sponsor our work. Kind words will touch our chakras and vibe, while the sponsorships will keep the open source projects alive.

## üöÄ Installation

To create a Laravel project image for Docker, head over to [renoki-co/laravel-helm-demo](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-helm-demo) to get started.

Install Helm chart repository:

```bash
$ helm repo add renoki-co https://helm.renoki-co.org
$ helm repo update
```

Install Laravel chart:

```bash
$ helm upgrade laravel-app \
    --install \
    --version=0.6.2 \
    renoki-co/laravel
```

Check `values.yaml` for additional available customizations.

### Environment variables

Laravel needs an `.env` file to keep secrets within, so you will need a secret from which they will be pulled. To do this, simply create a `laravel-app-env` secret with the `.env` key.

To replace the name, check for `app.envSecretName` in `values.yaml`. By default, the name is `<release name>-env`.

```yaml
kind: Secret
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: laravel-app-env
stringData:
  .env: |
    APP_NAME=Laravel
    APP_ENV=production
    APP_KEY=base64:kLHmdtqS0YnTACWSpkV4w1GVOQMEXQ68Usk8WR+yauA=
    APP_DEBUG=true
    APP_URL=http://test.laravel.com

    LOG_CHANNEL=null
    LOG_LEVEL=debug

    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=laravel
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=

    BROADCAST_DRIVER=log
    CACHE_DRIVER=file
    QUEUE_CONNECTION=sync
    SESSION_DRIVER=file
    SESSION_LIFETIME=120

    MEMCACHED_HOST=127.0.0.1

    REDIS_HOST=127.0.0.1
    REDIS_PASSWORD=null
    REDIS_PORT=6379

    MAIL_MAILER=smtp
    MAIL_HOST=mailhog
    MAIL_PORT=1025
    MAIL_USERNAME=null
    MAIL_PASSWORD=null
    MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
    MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=null
    MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
    AWS_BUCKET=

    PUSHER_APP_ID=
    PUSHER_APP_KEY=
    PUSHER_APP_SECRET=
    PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER=mt1

    MIX_PUSHER_APP_KEY="${PUSHER_APP_KEY}"
    MIX_PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER="${PUSHER_APP_CLUSTER}"
```

### Run workers (non-HTTP workload)

Workers can be for example long-lived commands, like `php artisan queue:work` commands or `php artisan horizon` that run in separate process than the web workers that serve HTTP content.

In `values.yaml`, you will find a list where you can define all the workers. Each worker will be in its own Deployment and you can define the command to run on each one, as well as the pod settings.

## Monitoring

### Scraping PHP-FPM and NGINX Metrics

PHP-FPM and NGINX containers within the Laravel app pod can expose metrics for Prometheus to scrape. When enabling the exporters, the following endpoints return Prometheus-readable metrics:

- `localhost:9253/metrics` - PHP-FPM metrics
- `localhost:9113/metrics` - NGINX metrics

### Healthchecks

Healthchecks are set up and enabled by default for both `/health` on the NGINX container (the web application that will serve the Laravel app) and the TCP :9000 port on PHP-FPM.

For convenience, you may use [renoki-co/laravel-healthcheck](https://github.com/renoki-co/laravel-healthchecks) to easily set up healthchecks in your app, just like in `app/Http/Controllers/HealthController`.
